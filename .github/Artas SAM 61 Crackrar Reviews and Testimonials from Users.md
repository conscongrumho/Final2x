Artas SAM 6.1 is a software package that allows you to design, analyze, and optimize mechanisms of various types and complexities. SAM stands for Synthesis and Analysis of Mechanisms, and it is developed by Artas Engineering Software, a company based in the Netherlands.
 
With SAM 6.1, you can create models of mechanisms using a graphical user interface, input motion data, define design variables and constraints, perform kinematic and dynamic analysis, generate animation and graphs of results, and use optimization tools to find the best design solution. SAM 6.1 supports different types of mechanisms, such as planar, spatial, gear, cam-follower, belt-pulley, chain-sprocket, and more.

SAM 6.1 is suitable for various applications, such as education, engineering design, research, and industry. It can help you to understand the principles of mechanism design and analysis, to test your ideas and concepts, to improve the performance and efficiency of your mechanisms, and to solve complex engineering problems.
 
If you want to try SAM 6.1 for yourself, you can download it from the official website of Artas Engineering Software[^1^]. You can use it in demo mode without a license key, but with some restrictions. Alternatively, you can request a free 4-weeks trial license to evaluate the full functionality of the software.

One of the main features of SAM 6.1 is the graphical user interface, which allows you to create and modify models of mechanisms using a mouse and a keyboard. You can choose from a library of standard elements, such as links, joints, gears, cams, followers, belts, pulleys, chains, sprockets, springs, dampers, and forces. You can also define your own custom elements and save them for future use. You can adjust the properties and parameters of each element, such as dimensions, mass, inertia, stiffness, damping, friction, and color. You can also add labels and annotations to your model for clarity and documentation.
 
Another feature of SAM 6.1 is the input motion data, which allows you to specify the desired motion of your mechanism. You can define the motion of one or more elements using different methods, such as constant velocity or acceleration, harmonic motion, polynomial function, spline function, or data table. You can also import motion data from external files or other software. SAM 6.1 will automatically calculate the motion of the rest of the elements using kinematic equations.

A third feature of SAM 6.1 is the analysis and optimization tools, which allow you to evaluate and improve your mechanism design. You can perform kinematic analysis to obtain the position, velocity, and acceleration of each element. You can perform dynamic analysis to obtain the forces and torques acting on each element. You can also perform static or dynamic balancing to minimize the vibration and noise of your mechanism. You can generate animation and graphs of your results to visualize the behavior and performance of your mechanism. You can also use optimization tools to find the optimal values of your design variables that satisfy your design objectives and constraints.
