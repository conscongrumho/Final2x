- Make sure you have enough space around the cutting plotter and the vinyl roll. Avoid placing any objects that may interfere with the movement of the cutting head or the media.
- Adjust the blade depth and the cutting force according to the type and thickness of the vinyl. You can use the test cut function in CutMate 2.1 to check the quality of the cut. The blade should cut through the vinyl but not the backing paper.
- Load the vinyl roll into the cutting plotter and align it with the guide rollers. Make sure the vinyl is flat and smooth on the cutting mat. You can use the up and down buttons on the control panel to move the cutting head and adjust the position of the vinyl.
- Set the origin point using the origin button on the control panel. This is where the cutting will start from. You can also use CutMate 2.1 to set a different origin point if you want.
- Design your graphics in CorelDRAW and send them to CutMate 2.1. You can use various tools and features in CorelDRAW to create your graphics, such as text, shapes, colors, effects, etc.
- In CutMate 2.1, you can preview your graphics and adjust some settings, such as size, rotation, mirror, offset, etc. You can also choose different cutting modes, such as outline, fill, or both.
- When you are ready to cut, click on the cut button in CutMate 2.1. The cutting plotter will start cutting your graphics according to your settings.
- After the cutting is done, unload the vinyl from the cutting plotter and peel off the excess vinyl. You can use a weeding tool to remove any small pieces of vinyl that are not part of your design.
- Apply a layer of transfer tape over your vinyl sticker and press it firmly with a squeegee or a scraper. This will help you transfer your sticker to another surface without damaging it.
- Carefully peel off the backing paper from your vinyl sticker and apply it to your desired surface. Make sure the surface is clean and dry before applying. Smooth out any air bubbles or wrinkles with a squeegee or a scraper.

You have successfully used your Redsail RS720C cutting plotter to cut vinyl stickers. You can now enjoy your custom-made stickers on your car, laptop, wall, or anywhere else you want.
 
## How to Maintain Redsail RS720C Cutting Plotter
 
To keep your Redsail RS720C cutting plotter in good condition and extend its lifespan, you need to perform some regular maintenance tasks. Here are some suggestions on how to maintain it:

- Clean the cutting plotter regularly with a soft cloth or a brush. Remove any dust or dirt that may accumulate on the surface or inside the machine.
- Lubricate the guide rails and the bearings with some oil or grease every few months. This will reduce friction and noise and improve performance.
- Replace the blade when it becomes dull or damaged. A dull blade will affect the quality of the cut and may damage the vinyl or the cutting mat.
- Replace the cutting mat when it becomes worn out or damaged. A worn-out mat will not hold the vinyl firmly and may cause slipping or shifting during cutting.
- Store the cutting plotter in a dry and cool place when not in use. Avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, high temperature, humidity, or water.

By following these maintenance tips, you can ensure that your Redsail RS720C cutting plotter will work smoothly and efficiently for a long time.
