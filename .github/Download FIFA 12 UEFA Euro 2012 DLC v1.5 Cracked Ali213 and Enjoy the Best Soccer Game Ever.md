1. Make sure you have FIFA 12 installed on your PC. You can buy it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/FIFA-Soccer-12-PC/dp/B0053BG26C) or [GameStop](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/pc/games/products/fifa-soccer-12/10091075.html), or download it from [Origin](https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/fifa/fifa-12).
2. Download the FIFA 12 UEFA Euro 2012 DLC v1.5 cracked by ALI213 from one of these links: [MediaFire](http://www.mediafire.com/?63klara1vha3v) [^1^], [FShare](http://www.fshare.vn/file/TW9A3QBBST/) [^1^], or [KiBuilder](http://kibuilder.com/BTb) [^3^]. The file size is about 4.2 GB and it is divided into several parts. You will need a program like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the files.
3. After extracting the files, you will get an ISO file named FIFA\_12\_UEFA\_Euro\_2012\_DLC\_v1.5\_CRACKED-ALI213.iso. You will need a program like [DAEMON Tools Lite](https://www.daemon-tools.cc/products/dtLite) or [PowerISO](https://www.poweriso.com/) to mount the ISO file as a virtual drive.
4. Open the virtual drive and run setup.exe to install the DLC. Follow the instructions on the screen and choose the same directory where you installed FIFA 12.
5. After installation, copy the contents of the Crack folder (located inside the ISO file) to the FIFA 12 game folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\FIFA 12), replacing the original files.
6. Launch FIFA 12 and enjoy playing UEFA Euro 2012!

Note: This is a cracked version of the DLC, which means it may not work properly or be compatible with online features. If you want to support the developers and get the official version of the DLC, you can buy it from [Origin](https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/fifa/fifa-12/addon/fifa-12-uefa-euro-2012) for $19.99.

But what about the game modes? Are they worth your money and time? Well, that depends on what you are looking for. UEFA Euro 2012 offers three main modes: Euro 2012, Expedition, and Challenges. Let's take a look at each one:
 
## Euro 2012
 
This is the core mode of the DLC, where you can play as any of the 53 UEFA national teams and try to win the coveted trophy. You can choose to play offline or online, with up to 16 players in a tournament. You can also customize your settings, such as difficulty, match length, injuries, and weather. The mode is faithful to the real-life competition, with all the groups, fixtures, venues, and rules. You can also view the statistics, standings, and awards of the tournament.
 
The gameplay is smooth and realistic, with the same engine and mechanics of FIFA 12. The teams are updated with their latest rosters and ratings, and the players have their authentic faces and kits. The commentary is also specific to the tournament, with Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend providing insights and anecdotes. The atmosphere is immersive and lively, with fans chanting, flags waving, and confetti flying. The mode is fun and challenging, especially if you play online against other human opponents.
 
However, there are some drawbacks to this mode. First of all, not all the teams are licensed. While the major ones like Spain, Germany, England, and France have their official kits and badges, some of the smaller ones like Wales, Montenegro, and Belarus have generic ones. This is a bit disappointing for fans of those teams or for those who want a complete authentic experience. Secondly, there is no option to create your own custom tournament or edit the groups. You have to stick with the real-life format and fixtures. This limits your replay value and creativity. Thirdly, there is no qualifying stage or friendly matches. You can only play the final tournament. This means you miss out on some of the drama and excitement of the road to Euro 2012.

## Expedition
 
This is a new mode that is exclusive to the DLC. It is a mix of RPG and strategy elements that lets you create your own fantasy team and conquer Europe. You start by choosing a captain from any of the UEFA national teams or importing your Virtual Pro. Then you get a random squad of low-rated players from different countries. Your goal is to beat other teams in a map-based system that resembles Risk or Civilization.
 
Each country has a number of territories that you have to win by playing matches against them. The matches are shorter than normal (4 minutes per half) and have different objectives, such as scoring first or keeping a clean sheet. If you win a match, you get to choose one player from the defeated team to join your squad. You can also get better players by completing group stages or winning trophies. As you progress, you unlock more countries to challenge and more regions to explore.
 
The mode is addictive and rewarding, as you build your dream team and improve your chemistry and rating. You can also customize your team's name, badge, kit, and formation. The map system is well-designed and easy to navigate. The matches are varied and challenging, with different difficulty levels and scenarios. The mode is also quite long and replayable, as you can try different captains or regions.
 
However, there are some flaws in this mode as well. First of all, there is no online multiplayer option. You can only play against the AI or invite a friend for local co-op or versus. This is a missed opportunity for some online fun and competition. Secondly, there is no way to save your progress or switch between different teams or regions. You have to stick with one captain and one region until you finish it or start over from scratch. This can be frustrating if you want to try something different or if you lose your data.
 
## Challenges
 
This is another new mode that is exclusive to the DLC. It is a collection of scenarios based on real-life matches from the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign and the tournament itself. You can play as either side in each challenge and try to change history or recreate it.
 
The challenges are updated regularly with new ones added as the tournament progresses. They are also ranked by difficulty (bronze, silver, gold) and reward you with XP points for completing them. The challenges
