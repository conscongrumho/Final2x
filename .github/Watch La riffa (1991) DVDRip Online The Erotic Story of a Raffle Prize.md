She is visited by her husband's lawyer, who informs her that she owes a lot of money to the hotel's creditors. He suggests that she sell the hotel or find another way to pay off the debt. Francesca refuses to sell the hotel, as it was her husband's dream. She then comes up with the idea of raffling off a night with herself to the hotel guests, who are mostly businessmen and tourists. She sets the price of each ticket at 50,000 lire (about $30) and hopes to sell 100 tickets.
 
The second segment, Winter, shows Francesca preparing for the raffle and meeting some of the participants. She hires a friend, Marta, to help her with the organization and promotion of the event. She also meets Lorenzo, a young journalist who is staying at the hotel for a few days. Lorenzo is intrigued by Francesca and her raffle, and tries to interview her for his magazine. Francesca initially rejects him, but later agrees to talk to him. They have a friendly conversation and feel a mutual attraction. Lorenzo buys a ticket for the raffle, hoping to win a night with Francesca.
 
The third segment, Spring, depicts the night of the raffle and its aftermath. Francesca draws the winning ticket from a bowl and announces the number: 17. The winner is Lorenzo, who is overjoyed and nervous. Francesca is also happy and nervous, as she has developed feelings for Lorenzo. They go to Francesca's room and spend the night together. They make love and talk about their lives and dreams. They confess their love for each other and decide to run away together.
 
The fourth segment, Summer, reveals the consequences of Francesca and Lorenzo's decision. They leave the hotel early in the morning and drive away in Lorenzo's car. However, they are followed by some of Francesca's creditors, who are angry that she has left without paying them. They catch up with them and force them to stop.
